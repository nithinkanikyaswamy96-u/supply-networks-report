**One-liner:**  
Comprehensive analysis of supply networks with focus on Toyota Motor Manufacturing (U.S.A.) – integrating lean principles (Kanban, Jidoka, Pull vs Push, Five Whys) to improve efficiency, quality, and cost control.

## ⭐ STAR Summary

**Situation**  
As part of the *Supply Networks* course (WS23/24, OVGU Magdeburg), we conducted a structured analysis of global supply chain fundamentals and applied them to a real-world case study: Toyota Motor Manufacturing U.S.A.  

**Task**  
Understand how lean methods can optimize supply chain performance, minimize waste, and balance trade-offs between efficiency and quality. Specifically, analyze Toyota’s practices of Just-in-Time (JIT), Jidoka, Pull vs Push, and the Five Whys problem-solving method.  

**Action**  
- Mapped the **supply chain structure** at Toyota Motor Manufacturing, highlighting supplier integration, logistics, assembly, and dealer networks.  
- Studied Toyota’s **Sequential Pull System** with Kanban, Andon, and Heijunka for demand-driven flow.  
- Applied the **Five Whys** methodology to identify root causes of equipment failures (e.g., welding robot breakdown).  
- Performed **Overtime & Cost Analysis** to evaluate trade-offs between run-ratio efficiency and jidoka-driven quality.  
- Consolidated lessons learned in both a **summary report** and a **detailed case study presentation**.  

**Result**  
- Delivered actionable insights on how **pull systems reduce inventory, jidoka ensures built-in quality, and root-cause analysis prevents downtime**.  
- Quantified the impact of decisions on **overtime and cost**, demonstrating real-world trade-offs in supply networks.  
- Created a knowledge base (report + presentation) useful for both academic and industrial contexts.
