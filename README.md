Simulation and analysis of global supply networks with emphasis on **structure, flows, and performance KPIs**.  
Focused on resilience, lead times, cost, and service-level tradeoffs.

## ⭐ Project Overview

**A) Situation**  
Global supply networks often face volatility in demand, high lead times, and fluctuating costs.  
We studied how network structure and inventory policies affect profitability and resilience.  

**B) Task**  
- Model supply network alternatives.  
- Evaluate KPI trade-offs: ROI, service level, utilization, and inventory.  
- Propose improvements for reliability and cost efficiency.  

**C) Action**  
- Constructed baseline network in simulation.  
- Tested parameter changes: supplier reliability, safety stocks, production intervals, warehouse locations.  
- Compared KPIs across scenarios.  

**D) Result**  
- Improved **service levels by ~8%** while keeping costs controlled.  
- Reduced obsoletes and optimized warehouse utilization.  
- Clear recommendations for balancing ROI and resilience.
